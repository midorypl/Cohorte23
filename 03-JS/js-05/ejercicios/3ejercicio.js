//Exercise #3
/**
Write a function that logs whether a number is between 0 and 25 (inclusive), 
between 26 and 100 (inclusive), greater than 100, or less than 0.
numberRange(25);   // '25 is between 0 and 25'
numberRange(75);   // '75 is between 26 and 100'
numberRange(125);  // '125 is greater than 100'
numberRange(-25);  // '-25 is less than 0'
